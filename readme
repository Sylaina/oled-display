Library for oled-displays with SSD1306 or SH1106 display-controller connected with I2C at an AVR Atmel Atmega like Atmega328P.

This library allows you to display text or/and graphic at oled-display.
The library need less then 2000 bytes flash-memory in textmode and less then 3200 bytes in graphicmode so you can use oled-displays e.g with Atmega48PA.
Library is only tested with 128x64 Pixel display, lower resolution not tested but should work too.

If you want to use your own I2C Library you have to fit i2c-function at lcd-library.
Settings for I2C-bus have to set at i2c.h
Settings for display have to set at lcd.h

exampel:

//****main.c****//
#include "lcd.h"


int main(void){
  lcd_init(LCD_DISP_ON);    // init lcd and turn on
  
  lcd_puts("Hello World");  // put string from RAM to display (TEXTMODE) or buffer (GRAPHICMODE)
  lcd_gotoxy(0,2);          // set cursor to first column at line 3
  lcd_puts_p(PSTR("String from flash"));  // puts string form flash to display (TEXTMODE) or buffer (GRAPHICMODE)
#if defined GRAPHICMODE
  lcd_drawCircle(64,32,7,WHITE); // draw circle to buffer
  lcd_display();                  // send buffer to display
#endif
  for(;;){
    //main loop
  }
  return 0;
}
